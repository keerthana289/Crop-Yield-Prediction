# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **predicting crop yield** using key agricultural factors such as **rainfall, temperature, and fertilizer usage**.  
A **Random Forest Regression model** is trained to learn patterns from historical data and predict crop yield accurately.

The project is designed with a **modular structure**, making it easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Crop yield depends on multiple environmental and farming factors.  
Accurately predicting yield helps farmers and agricultural planners make better decisions.

**Objective:**  
To build a machine learning model that predicts **crop yield** based on:
- Rainfall
- Temperature
- Fertilizer usage

## 📂 Dataset Description
- **File Name:** `crop_yield.csv`
- **Target Variable:** `yield`
- **Input Features:**
  - `rainfall` – Amount of rainfall (mm)
  - `temperature` – Average temperature (°C)
  - `fertilizer` – Fertilizer usage (kg/hectare)
